📊 Subscription Analytics Data Pipeline using Python

A complete Python-based ETL and data generation pipeline for simulating a real-world subscription analytics ecosystem.
This project creates large-scale datasets suitable for:

✔ Power BI Dashboards
✔ SQL Analytics
✔ Churn Prediction
✔ Customer Segmentation
✔ Cohort Retention Analysis
✔ Excel Reporting

🚀 Project Overview

This project generates and preprocesses synthetic business datasets for a subscription-based platform (EdTech / SaaS / OTT).
It includes:

20,000 Customers

35,000 Subscription Records

600,000+ Usage Logs

18,000 Support Tickets

3 Subscription Plans

Using these datasets, analysts can perform advanced analytics such as:

Revenue Insights

User Engagement Tracking

Churn Analysis

Retention Cohorts

LTV & ARPU

Support Efficiency

🧠 Key Features
🎯 1. Data Generation with Python

Uses Faker, Pandas, NumPy, and random to simulate realistic data

Generates demographics, subscription lifecycle, engagement logs, and support tickets

Mimics real business KPIs like churn, usage patterns, renewal cycles, etc.

🧼 2. ETL & Data Cleaning

Date formatting

Type conversion

Null handling

Feature engineering

Ready for SQL / BI tools

📂 3. Analytics-ready Datasets

Fully structured CSVs for downstream tools:

Power BI

SQL Server / MySQL

Excel

Python ML models
